# minesweeper
Simulates the classic game "Minesweeper" in a text-based version with Python. Missing the feature of 'flagging' mines.
I was first inspired to build this in my senior year of high school for AP Comp Sci's final project. Minesweeper's recursive procedure of checking adjacent squares' adjacent squares drew my interest, but I wasn't able to complete the project in time. Even if this is only a basic understanding of Python and it took a while, I'm pretty proud of completing it.
